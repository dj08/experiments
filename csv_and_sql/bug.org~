#+TITLE: Bug report
#+PROPERTY: mkdirp yes

* Setup
Need to exec this first in order for sqlite src to be exec'ed.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
(org-babel-do-load-languages
 'org-babel-load-languages
 '((emacs-lisp . t)
   (sh         . t)
   (sqlite     . t)
   (C          . t)))
#+END_SRC

* CSV files
For a sample, I have the following CSV file:

#+BEGIN_SRC csv :tangle sample1.csv
Year,Make,Model,Description,Price
1997,Ford,E350,"ac, abs, moon",3000.00
1999,Chevy,"Venture ""Extended Edition""","",4900.00
1999,Chevy,"Venture ""Extended Edition, Very Large""",,5000.00
1996,Jeep,Grand Cherokee,"MUST SELL!
air, moon roof, loaded",4799.00
#+END_SRC

* Playing with SQL
Now stat playing with SQL. 

The following snippet works fine:
#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite :db bug.db :exports results :results verbatim
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cars;
CREATE TABLE cars (Year,Make,Model,Description,Price);
.mode csv
.separator ","
.import sample1.csv cars
SELECT * FROM cars;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Year,Make,Model,Description,Price
: 1997,Ford,E350,"ac, abs, moon",3000.00
: 1999,Chevy,"Venture ""Extended Edition""","",4900.00
: 1999,Chevy,"Venture ""Extended Edition, Very Large""","",5000.00
: 1996,Jeep,"Grand Cherokee","MUST SELL!
: air, moon roof, loaded",4799.00


However, the following fails, just because =:results= is set to default.
# BEGIN_SRC sqlite :db sample.db :exports results :results verbatim
#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite :db sample.db :exports results
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cars;
CREATE TABLE cars ( Year,Make,Model,Description,Price );
select * from cars;
.mode csv
.import sample1.csv cars
SELECT * FROM cars;
#+END_SRC
